# Create UI and Data apps

Create UI for machine learning models and to build data apps in Python.


Open a terminal and run:

    $ pip install streamlit
  
    $ streamlit hello
  
If this opens our sweet Streamlit Hello app in your browser, you're all set! If not, head over to [docs](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/get-started) for specific installs.
